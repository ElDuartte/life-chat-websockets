# Task Breakdown:
1. Set Up Project Environment
- Task: Initialize a new project directory.
- Sub-tasks:
  - Create a new directory for your project.
  - Initialize a package.json file using npm init or yarn init.
  - Install necessary dependencies, including a WebSocket library like ws (for Node.js).
  - Install any required TypeScript configuration (if using TypeScript).
2. Create the WebSocket Server
  - Task: Develop a WebSocket server to handle client connections.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Create a server using Node.js (e.g., with http and ws modules).
    - Set up a WebSocket server using the ws library.
    - Define logic to handle incoming WebSocket connections.
    - Implement a broadcast method to send messages to all connected clients.
3. Implement Message Handling on the Server
  - Task: Create logic for handling incoming chat messages.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Define a message format (e.g., JSON structure with properties like username, message, timestamp).
    - Implement a function to handle incoming messages, parse them, and broadcast them to other clients.
    - Add validation checks (e.g., non-empty message, valid JSON format).
4. Save Chat Messages to a JSON File
  - Task: Store chat messages in a JSON file on the server.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Create a function to append each chat message to a JSON file.
    - Use Node.js file system (fs) module for writing and reading messages to/from the file.
    - Implement error handling to manage file read/write operations.
    - Optionally, implement logic to load previous chat history when the server starts.
5. Create the Client-Side Application
  - Task: Develop a simple web-based client to interact with the WebSocket server.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Set up a basic HTML page with a chat interface (input box, send button, display area for messages).
    - Use vanilla JavaScript or a front-end framework (e.g., React) to handle client-side WebSocket connection.
    - Implement event listeners for sending messages to the WebSocket server.
    - Display incoming messages in the chat window.
6. Establish WebSocket Connection from Client to Server
  - Task: Connect the client to the WebSocket server.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Write JavaScript code to create a WebSocket connection to the server.
    - Implement connection handling (e.g., onopen, onmessage, onclose, onerror events).
    - Display status updates on the client (e.g., connected, disconnected).
7. Implement Real-Time Message Updates on the Client
  - Task: Display real-time messages on the client side as they are received.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Handle incoming WebSocket messages in the client to update the chat window.
    - Append new messages to the chat display area dynamically.
    - Add timestamps and formatting to messages.
8. Testing and Debugging
  - Task: Test the real-time chat functionality and fix any issues.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Test the WebSocket connection stability (connect, disconnect, reconnect).
    - Verify message broadcasting works as expected.
    - Check if messages are correctly saved to and read from the JSON file.
    - Test error scenarios (e.g., WebSocket connection failure, invalid messages).
9. Implement Basic Security and Error Handling
  - Task: Add basic security measures and error handling.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration if needed.
    - Add input sanitization to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
    - Handle WebSocket connection errors gracefully.
10. Documentation and Deployment
  - Task: Document the code and prepare for deployment.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - Write a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.
    - Document the WebSocket API (message format, events).
    - Deploy the server on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) or local server.
    - Test the deployment environment to ensure everything works.
## Completion Criteria:
  - A functioning real-time chat application with:
    - WebSocket-based communication.
    - Messages saved in a JSON file.
    - A client interface that can send and receive messages in real-time.
    - Proper documentation and deployment setup.
